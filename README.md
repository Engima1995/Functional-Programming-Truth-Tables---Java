# Functional Programming in Java

This program utilises the new Java 8 functionalities to develop programs in the Functional Paradigm.

The concept of this program is to use provided libraries by the University to construct a program entirely in Functional Programming which creates truth tables by passing parameters.

For example:

By passing the number 1, the program should create the values True and False by default. This is then used to construct a tautology. In this case because the value is 1, therefore the answer is True and False.

If the number was 2, then the program creates 4 rows with 2 columns such as:

True True
True False
False True
False False

Which is then further evaluated to give a tautology. 

## To run the program

Get the copy of the program through this github page and make sure you have an appropriate development editor and Java SDK/JDK installed. 

This program was done using Eclipse Editor.
